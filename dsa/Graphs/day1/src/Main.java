// search in adjacency matrix : 1
        // search in adj list : V time

        // both has its own advantages dis advantages :
        // if search use adj matrix or delete
        // if space use adj list//
        //insertion both order of 1 time

        // if dense graph use adj matrix => no of edges are equal to v^2: complete graph
        // complete graph where every node is connected to every other node// search
        // this makes search time insert delete  fast /
        // if sparse graph no of edges r comparatively less

        // ADJ Mat: space V2 , time search: 1
        // ADJ Lis: space 2*E+V, time search: v
