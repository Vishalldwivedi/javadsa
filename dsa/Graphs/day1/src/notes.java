    // A graph is a non linear data structure consisting of edges and vertices

    // node is a vertices
    // garph can be donoted as G(V,E) set of vertices and edges

    // Types of graph :
    // .1. null graph : only nodes no edges
    // 2. Trivial graph : smalles possible graph (only single vertex)
    // 3. undirected graph : no direction in edges two way(unordered pair nodes)
    // 4. directed graph : a graph in which edge has an direction ;
    // 5. connected graph: wifi , a graph in which from one node we can go to any other node
    // 6. disconnected graph : a graph in which at least one node is not connect to other
    //7. regular graph : a graph in which degree of every vertex is k is called k degree graph
    // 8 complete graph : ever node is connect to every other node
    // 9. cycle graph : a graph that has a cycle in itself degree will be 2
    // 10 cyclic graph : a graph in which there is at lease one cycle
    // 10 directed acyclic graph : no cycle but direction
    // 12. bipartite graph : a graph in which vertices divided into two sets such that vertices in same set does not for edge with
    // each other
    // 13: weighted graph : eges contain weight
    // 14. undirected weight graph : directed graph



    // Tree : all tree are a graph but all graph r not tree
    // tree: trees are restricted types of graph
    //
